Forever Engine Eternal allows a scripting system powered by HScript.
HScript is a scripting system allowing to write haxe code outside of the source code.
Everthing can be made using functions called by the game, such as `create`. It does not allow custom classes at the moment, but will be available soon.

HScript files support these following extensions:
```
.hx
.hxs
.hxc
.hsc
.hscript
.hxclass (When the custom HScript classes will release)
```

HScript files have several variables exposed publicly to every created script, those being:
```
Std
Math
FlxG
FlxSprite
FlxSound
FlxGroup
FlxTween
FlxEase
FlxTimer
FlxMath
FNFSprite
Conductor
StringTools
Tools
```

HScript can be used in various things like shaders, stages etc.
Happy coding!
